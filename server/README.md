<p>MyResearch Server side was done using the Rest API aproach along with The MVC architecture.</p>

<p>Three folders each representing the MVC architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>models: <br/>This file contains all the objects schema for the database: Student,Project,Faculty</li>
<li>routes:<br/>This file contains the routes for the different objects of the database, Notably The CRUD routes(get_id,get_name...)</li>
<li>Controller:<br/>This file contains the logic behind each CRUD operation</li>
</ul>
<p>To secure access to the different directories api, we opted for a Oauth Token Based ( Accessing each directory of the API needs a authentification token</p> 

<p>Demo of the app can be found at: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yNqj_QzQiZGdh6AiYZwfJZEgJjeJqF5z/view?usp=sharing">drive</a></p>
